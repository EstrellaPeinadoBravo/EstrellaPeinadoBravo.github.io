I am a full-time, non-tenure track assistant professor at the Department of Marketing and International Business, Universidad del Pacifico (Peru).  My current research interest relates to new product introductions and innovation activities in SMEs in emerging economies. 

You can find my pre-doctoral research work [here](https://EstrellaPeinadoBravo.github.io/publications/ "To current research"), and my cv with details about my experience as a junior faculty member [here](https://EstrellaPeinadoBravo.github.io/cv/ "To my CV").
